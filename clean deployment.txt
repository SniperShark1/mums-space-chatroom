No, you don’t need to delete the entire Vercel project to start fresh.
What you do instead:

    Clean your codebase locally (delete unwanted files/folders like client/, vite.config.ts, and index.html outside Next.js structure)

    Push the clean code to GitHub

    In Vercel, clear the build cache and redeploy

This effectively gives you a fresh start without losing your project settings, domain links, or analytics.

If you want a truly clean slate with zero risk, you can create a new Vercel project and deploy there — but usually it’s not necessary.

clean deployment tomorrow

Here’s what we’ll do, based on your points:

    Confirm all Vite files/folders are deleted locally and pushed:

        Delete vite.config.ts (done)

        Delete client/ folder (if still exists)

        Delete any index.html files outside Next.js structure

    Confirm your package.json scripts are Next.js only (you have this correct).

    Double-check there is no vercel.json file.

    In Vercel:

        Set Framework to Next.js

        Root Directory blank

        No build/output overrides

        Clear build cache if possible

    Force clean redeploy:

git commit --allow-empty -m "Force clean deploy"
git push
